# Simple Shell !

## Welcome to the Simple Shell project !

This project is part of my curriculum at Holberton School. It is the second major group project, and also the final project of the first trimester.
Carried out in collaboration with two other students, the goal was to build our own Unix command-line interpreter, called Simple Shell.
The work had to follow strict technical guidelines, including rules on coding style, modularity, and performance. All the requirements and constraints are detailed in the following sections of this README.
